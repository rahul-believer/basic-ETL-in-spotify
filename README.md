# basic-ETL-in-spotify
## Reason to make this:
### I make dubstep and dance music as a hobby so i wanted to know what kind of things work on soptify and what don't. This basically gives information to bedroom music producers to know what to use in their music like BPM(Tempo), which key to use etc.

# What I learned from this/Takeaway:

- Keep songs in 110-150 bpm mostly.
- When mastering, keep in mind to master in -14db to -5db. Louder than that can harm user experience.
- Most songs are in Major keys, Mostly c major and a major.
- major chords sound happy and minor chords sad or less happy.
